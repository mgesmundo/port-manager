# Port Manager

Port Manager is a small tool to find available TCP ports within a given range or a multiple range. It is inspired to [Harbor](https://www.npmjs.org/package/harbor) module with some improvements:

- capability to add multiple ports range
- capability to exclude multiple ports range
- capability to claim a specific port for a service even if it is outside the given range
- capability to release automatically a claimed port if it is not in use anymore
- chainable.

## Installation

Port Manager can be installed via [npm](http://npmjs.org).

```sh
$ npm install port-manager
```

## Quick Start

To use `port-manager` simply `require` it and use its default port range between 8000 and 9000:

```js
var manager = require('port-manager')();

manager.claim('http', function (err, service) {
  console.log(service.port);    // 8000
  //...
});
```

The primary export is a factory, but you can also create new `Manger` instance manually:

```js
var Manager = require('port-manager');
var manager = new Manager();

manager
  .include(2000, 3000)
  .include(4000)
  .exclude(2001, 2100)
  .claim('http1')
  .claim('http2')
  ;

manager.on('claim', function (service) {
  console.log(service.name, service.port);
  // in your terminal you see two rows:
  // http1  2000
  // http2  2101
});

// other events
manager.on('release', function (service) {
  console.log('released service ' + service.name + ' at port ' + service.port);
});
```

If you want to claim a port that can be released automatically when it is not in use anymore, you can set the `heartbeat` parameter (in milliseconds) in your `Manager` constructor:

```js
var Manager = require('port-manager');
var manager = new Manager(1000);

manager
  .include(2000, 3000)
  .claim('http', function (err, service) {
    //...
  });
```

In the example above, every 1000 ms the service is verified and if its port is not in use a `release` event occur and the port is available for a next `claim`.

## Tests

As usual our tests are written in the BDD styles for the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test runner using the `should` assertion interface and the great test spies tool [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org).
To run the test simply type in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm test
```
